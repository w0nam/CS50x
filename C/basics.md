## Basics principals of the C programing language.

C is a programming language around since the 70's. It use a complicated synthax, using curly brackets, parenthesis, semi-columns, etc...
C has the advantages of being blazing fast, fairly low level on hardware & easy to understand (once you figure stuff out). One downside of such power is that it require you to understand how a computer work: You have to manage your RAM yourself. There is no Garbage collector & the program will always assume that the human behind the screen will always input something right.
(for example: If you want to ask permission using 'y' or 'n' char. C will not accept 'Y' or 'N' or 'H'. He will just ignore you and quit the program.)

C may be complicated at first, but honestly not that much. I will continue to learn it even after my CS50x certificate.
