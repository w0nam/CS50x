#Week 0, Scratch.

Scratch is a proogramming language & an IDE developped by MIT in order for the youngster to learn about programming.
At first i wanted to create a complex game (learning Linux bash through a 2D game), then an other complex game (Space Invader clone), then finally, i have settled on a snake clone...

Developing game is way harder then i thought. So i will keep thing simple in order to validate my module & push forward in the CS50x training (we have a final deadline, 5th of january 2025)
So there it is, my snake clone. I will surely give it a meme name just so i can laugh a bit about it.
